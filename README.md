Several script to automatize my home

The idea is to centralize the work i do in home automation, the scripts that ocures to me in order to:
- secure the house
- implement domotic ligths anbd stuff.

Lighting

Turn the light on in the night for a couple hours, later turn them off. Add some randomness to the exact starting and finishing time.
