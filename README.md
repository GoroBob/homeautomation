Several script to automatize my home

The idea is to centralize the work i do in home automation, the scripts that ocures to me in order to:
- secure the house
- implement domotic ligths anbd stuff.

Lighting

Turn the light on in the night for a couple hours, later turn them off. Add some randomness to the exact starting and finishing time.

Entrance sensors

- Add PIR sensor  
- add openning sensor
- add camera

Connect all to the raspberry by wire or wifi. Connect to the internet using the cellphone.

Connect to a server in aws, so this one send message is the propoer trigger is activated (open door, PIR change), and make video in that case.
